<p>The Earth is our home, just as it is of millions of other life forms. If we do not protect our home, we may lose it. Then we would be homeless, and along with all life forms we would perish.

If we wish to protect the human race, and all the other life forms, we must ensure that the planet we live on is protected.

The Earth sustains life because of the natural resources like sunshine, air water and vegetation available on the planet. We can protect the Earth by not polluting and destroying it. Due to many of manâ€™s activities there has been a continuous degradation of the Earth, and its resources like air, land and water. Air pollution, deforestation, soil erosion and water pollution are some of the environmental problems confronting us.

By pollution and environmental degradation, life on Earth is threatened. We must therefore save the Earth.

We are making our Contribution to Save the Earth by Planting trees. One can donate the trees also request the trees to plant. 

Let us Contribute our part to save the Earth.
